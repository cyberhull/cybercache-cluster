Building CyberCache Cluster
===========================

To build CyberCache components, you need CMake version 3.5 or higher.

CMake **MUST** be run from this direcory (`build`) so that packaging, testing,
and various maintenance scripts could find executables and dynamic libraries
produced by the build process.
